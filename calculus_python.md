## Derivatives
### Derivative Notation
###### 𝚫dx  - change in x direction
##### _______
###### 𝚫dt - changes in the t direction
1. Lagrange: f'(x)
######  The function is f and at the point x the slope of the line is f'(x), that is like Lagrange's notation.
2. Leibenz: dy/dx or d/dx(f(x))
###### And the other one is the one you just saw, which is dy over dx, that can also be expressed as d over dx of f(x). In this case d over dx can be thought of as an operator, something that when you apply to f(x) you get something else, and this is Leibniz's notation. 

### Formulas for Derivatives🔴
1. Derivative of a Constant

###### Since the derivative of a function represents the slope of the function, the derivative of a constant function must be equal to its slope of zero. This gives you the first derivative rule – the Constant Rule. If f(x) = k, where k is any real number, then the derivative is equal to zero.

2. Derivative of a Constant (number) * Variable

###### the derivative of the scalar * the derivative of the Variable will always be zero because the derivative of a constant (number) is zero.

3. Derivative of a Function x^n
##### To find the derivative of function x^n , take nx^n-1
##### for example: the derivative of x^4 = 4x^3

### Common Derivatives
1. Constants / Lines / Distance

###### slope = 𝚫x / 𝚫t
3. Linear Functions
4. Polynomial Quadratic Functions

###### slope = 𝚫f / 𝚫x = (x + 𝚫x)^2-(x)^2 / 𝚫x

5. Higher Degree Polynomials

###### slope = 𝚫f / 𝚫x = (x + 𝚫x)^3-(x)^3 / 𝚫x
7. Exponential and Logarithmic Functions


##### The Exponential e

7. Trigonometric Functions
8. The Inverse Function

### Rules of Derivative
1. Chain Rule: f(g(x)) =  g′(x)⋅f(g(x))

### Other Operations
1. Multiplication by Scalars /  Constants
### Plotting - Maxima and Minima

### Partial Derivatives

### Gradients

## Gradient Descent for Machine Learning Optimization

## Newton's Method
###### an alternative to Gradient Descent that finds the Zeros of the function which become the candidates for minimum and maximum points.
